        <!-- <h2>We evaluated the sentiments in the present technological age over the reviews of online products, online products are used by the majority of people. They provide their feedback and then products are recommended for purchase and sale on that factor too. The large e-commerce platforms such as Flipkart, Myntra, Amazon, and many others enable their users to review the Products. To buy a commodity, the consumer will examine to have a better-quality understanding of the product and product work. The interpretation will be a really simple product polarized into positive, neutral, and negative Product checks. We may use machine learning methods to perform this experiment. Sentiment Analysis is research in which consumers are conscious of a product reaction. A Kaggle of amazon product reviews gathers the data collection used. We use various Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, and Random Forest methodology for classifying feedback and achieving the best of precision. Among all the algorithms used we find that the Random forest machinelearning algorithm to be the most accurate.</h2> -->

            The interpretation of the system is really simple here we read all the reviews regarding a product in the dataset and basis of the polarizations of each review in the whole dataset and classify them into positive , neutral and negative reviews.
            For which we use machine learning methods  for purpose of classification where in this system we have used Random Forest algorithm to do the task.
